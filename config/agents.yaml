# AI Agent Configuration
# Configure which AI coding assistants to use and how they should collaborate

agents:
  # OpenAI Codex - Primary implementation agent
  codex:
    enabled: true
    command: "codex"
    role: "implementation"
    timeout: 300
    description: "Primary implementation agent for writing initial code"

  # Google Gemini - Code review and architecture analysis

# Workflow Definitions
# Define how agents collaborate on different types of tasks

workflows:
  # Default workflow: Implementation -> Review -> Refinement
  default:
    - agent: "codex"
      task: "implement"
      description: "Create initial implementation"

    - agent: "gemini"
      task: "review"
      description: "Review for SOLID principles and best practices"

    - agent: "claude"
      task: "refine"
      description: "Implement feedback and improvements"

  # Quick workflow: Just implementation
  quick:
    - agent: "codex"
      task: "implement"
      description: "Quick implementation without review"

  # Thorough workflow: Multiple review cycles
  thorough:
    - agent: "codex"
      task: "implement"
      description: "Create initial implementation"

    - agent: "copilot"
      task: "suggestions"
      description: "Get alternative approaches"

    - agent: "gemini"
      task: "review"
      description: "Comprehensive code review"

    - agent: "claude"
      task: "refine"
      description: "Implement all feedback"

    - agent: "gemini"
      task: "review"

  # Review-only: For existing code
  review-only:
    - agent: "gemini"
      task: "review"
      description: "Review existing code"

    - agent: "claude"
      task: "refine"
